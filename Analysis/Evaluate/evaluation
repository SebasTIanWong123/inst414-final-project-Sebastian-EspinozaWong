My intention is to evaluate the statistics of Lebron James, and then create visualizations that can show certain metrics or indicators that can be applied to multiple players who play basketball and eventually create these models for all differnt sports! I will use a linear regression analysis for lebron james points over his career measures by his age. As you can see, in both of the Linear Regression models you can see that the line indictating regression is slowly declining as the age of Lebron James gets older, indicting that LeBrons performance will go down, but it also show that comparatively to other players, Lebron will stil be averaging a lot of points compared to other players his age. With a normal player, We will be able to see the degree of decline of a player and see if a player is expected to rapidly decline or do better.
