# Project Overview:
# This project is meant to show data from basketball players, things such as their stats should be scrapped from two website and then input in here.The business problem we are trying to solve is allowing sports teams to have better accuracy towards player trends, injuries, and other basketball metrics. In specific, we wil primarily be using:
# Basketball-Reference: https://www.basketball-reference.com/
# We will use a secondary website if needed: https://www.espn.com/nba/stats
# *More specifically, Ill be trying to extract Lebron James Stats*


# Set up instructions:

# In order to set this repository up, we must first clone it from github, link found here: https://github.com/SebasTIanWong123/inst414-final-project-Sebastian-EspinozaWong.git

# Activate venv enviroment setting, allowing for better connectivity for the project. I also suggest installing Rainbow CSV and ROS exntension on VS Code

# Running Code:
# In order to run the project I will be primarily made with the ETL, this will have the code to extract, load, and transform the basketball data. Secondly, I will use the Analysis programs which include evaluate.py and model.py to then gather this data and then I will add the visualization in the visualization section, I will also be attempting to use Tableau.
